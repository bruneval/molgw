Installation:

MOLGW needs Fortran 2003, c and c++ compilers.
The machine dependent variables should be set in file ~molgw/src/my_machine.arch
Examples for this file are given in the folder ~molgw/config/.
Then
cd ~molgw/src
make

* BLAS and LAPACK linear algebra libraries are required.
* libint is required:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libint/files/libint-for-beginners/libint-2.0.0-prealpha.tgz/download
* libxc is required: (version > 2.0.1) for DFT calculations
http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/down.php?file=libxc/libxc-2.0.1.tar.gz


Basis sets:
Basis sets can be obtained from https://bse.pnl.gov/bse/portal
The file can be generated from a NWChem file using the script
./util/basis_nwchem2molgw.py B_aug-cc-pVDZ.nwchem


Usage:
The basis file needs to be located in the working directory.
./molgw < helium.in > helium.out

Example input files can be found in ./tests/


To be done:
* pseudopotentials (e.g. ECP or Goedecker flavor)
* parallelization!
* TD-DFT using GGA

Known issues:
* QPscGW scf loop is quite unstable for large basis sets, use a low alpha (<= 0.50)
* Use of linearization of the GW self-energy can affect the QP energies (50 meV difference is observed)
